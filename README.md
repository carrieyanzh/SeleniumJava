Option	Pros	Cons	Best Use Case
1. Pass URL via TestNG parameter	- Fully configurable via XML.
- No code changes needed to run the same test in different environments.	- XML gets verbose with many URLs.
- Less visible in code which URL is used.	Best for environment-specific runs, e.g., QA vs Staging vs Prod.
2. Navigate in the test class	- Clear and explicit in code which page is opened.
- Decouples BaseTest from URL concerns.	- Needs each test class to call driver.get() manually.	Best for different test flows per class, or when URLs vary frequently.
3. Use helper method in BaseTest	- Keeps navigation DRY (openUrl(url) method).
- Test class still controls which URL.	- Slight boilerplate in each test class.	Good if you want centralized method but still per-class flexibility.

For most flexible and maintainable design, Option 2 + Option 3 combination is ideal:

Let BaseTest handle browser setup only.

Each test class calls a helper like openUrl(url) for the page it needs.

XPATH: HTML: 
<a>
  <i></i>
  <div class="info">
    <span class="title">My account</span>
  </div>
</a>

//a//span[@class='title']
Starts from <a> node.
//span = search any descendant <span> at any depth, regardless of how many intermediate elements exist.
Finds the <span> even if the hierarchy changes (e.g., extra <div> added, <span> moved deeper).
Pros:
Robust to minor changes in HTML structure.
Simpler, shorter, easier to read.
Cons:
If there are multiple <span class="title"> under the <a>, you may accidentally select the wrong one

//a//div//span[@class='title']
Starts from <a> node.

//div = search for any <div> descendant of <a> at any depth.

//span[@class='title'] = search for <span> at any depth under that <div>.

Pros:

Slightly more specific, ensures the <span> is inside a <div>.

Useful if <a> contains multiple <span>s, but only some are inside <div>s.

Cons:

Less robust if the <div> layer is removed or replaced in a future HTML change.

Slightly longer XPath.

3️⃣ When to prefer which
Situation	Preferred XPath
You just want the <span> text and there’s only one <span class="title"> under <a>	//a//span[@class='title']
You want to ensure the <span> is inside a <div>, because <a> contains multiple <span>s	//a//div//span[@class='title']
You want exact hierarchy match	/a/div/span[@class='title'] (direct child)

4️⃣ Selenium practical tip
Always target the element that actually contains the visible text (like the <span> here), not the parent <a> if it contains icons or extra nested tags.

Keep XPath as short and robust as possible to avoid brittle locators when HTML changes.

1️⃣ final in Java

final on a local variable means: once assigned, the variable cannot point to another object.

It does NOT make the object itself immutable. You can still call methods on it and change its internal state.
